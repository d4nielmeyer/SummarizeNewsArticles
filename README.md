# SummarizeNewsArticles

Fictional scenario: A News Media firm uses flashcards of broad news articles to design the front page of their blog, which is read by more than a million readers across the globe. To develop the content for these flashcards, the news editors manually summarize the prospective news articles. This process is very time-consuming. Therefore the idea campe up to build a text summarizer to automatically generate summaries that could act as fairly good starting points.

## Project Outline:

- Loading and segregating the CNN News dataset
- Extracting summaries from the stories with ROUGE score
- Dataset investigation and training a baseline extractive summarization model
- Running sample predictions and evaluation of the baseline (CNN-LSTM) model
- Plugging the attention mechanism into the CNN-LSTM model

## Tech Stack:

- string
- rouge
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- sklearn
- tensorflow
- wandb
